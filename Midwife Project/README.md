Project midewife is one of my side project during the pandemic.

This project is asked by my mother as midwife in her own clinic. She complains that identify the type of payment lately will
affect the cumulation of work in the end of month and submit it to the government. Or even the common payment that is too late to be paid by the patient.

My job is making a visualization to understand the previous patient.
1. Identify how many type of transactions that is paid in her clinic
2. Identify what type of patient job that mostly they will pay 
3. Identify when patients mostly give birth
4. Making a machine learning to predict the type of transaction that patient will use.

The result of machine learning unfortunately isn't satisfied with the accuracy arround 55%. The evaluation has been done with
confusion matrix and AUC around 65%. It isn't satisfied due to a few amount of features. My mother as midwife has to collect
more data and more feature to generate the best prediction and help her in transaction case.
